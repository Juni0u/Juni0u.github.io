    <center><h2>ABOUT ME...</h2></center>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p align="justify">Hi again!  My name is Felipe Nonato and I'm from Brazil! Although I started studying Electrical Engineering focused on power plants
      and electrical power systems, I moved to Computer Science! I'm not going to say I hated what I did, but I can say that I'm studying what I always 
      wanted to study! 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I am as Master's student in the University of Tsukuba under the supervision of Professor 
      <a href="http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/">Claus Aranha</a>. My research is focused on extracting a sequence of events that relate to each other from a completed A.I.Wolf game. 
      I have been using graph theory to build a small text with events that make sense using content from the game! I'm really into graphs! I think they offer us a great way to represent knowledge, with ways to offer us explanation of the whys and what models give us in their output!
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I like to play rpg games. Persona and Dragon Age are my favorite series! I'm interested in soulslike lately too. Loved (and hated) playing Sekiro! Today I have been imersed in Baldur's Gate 3! Still can't decide if I want to play a Barbarian or a Rogue...wait. Maybe...BOTH!?
                       I also like to read books with investigation stories. Mainly Agatha Christie, but I'm into Sherlock Holmes too! I'm also a big fan of the "world's best detective" (a.k.a Batman)! If you didn't read "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd", just DO IT! It's like, the best thing ever written. 
                       I'm into sports too! Specially football! "É o <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eah4wXhlGME">Flamengo</a>, não tem jeito!" 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Other than that, I'm often finding new things to learn. I've been learning how to ~ gamedev ~ lately, and have been getting into make a thing that makes things. :) 
                       Keep checking my blog for more updates if you're interested! :D
                       Nice to meet you!
