    <center><h2>ABOUT ME...</h2></center>

    <p align="justify">Hello!  My name is Felipe Nonato and I'm from Brazil! Although I started studying Electrical Engineering focused on power plants
      and electrical power systems, I moved to Computer Science! I'm not going to say I hated what I did, but I can say that I'm studying what I always 
      wanted to study! 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Right now I'm a PhD student in the University of Tsukuba under the supervision of Professor 
      <a href="http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/">Claus Aranha</a>. I'm interested in weird and unique stuff that computers can make! It's just really cool how procedural content generation has the power of creating new experiences in existing game genres. Like how Spelunky transforms the platformer genre by creating an experience that the player has to adapt to ever changing levels. I am specially interested in information games and how we can grasp the power of procedural generation to create this mix in how we tell stories in or of games. 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I play a lot of stuff. But I really like RPGs! Persona and Dragon Age are my favorite series. I do like to be challenged too, so I'm in a quest to play some fromSoftware games. Loved (and hated) playing Sekiro! I have been a Switch gamer lately, but you can find me in all platforms. My favorite type of game when I'm not by myself are probably the ones that make me laught with my friends. Pico Park and Lethal Company come to mind!</p>

    <p align="justify">Reading detective books is another hobby of mine! Do you know Thomas and Tuppence?! Or Mounsier Poirot!? Miss. Marple! They are all Agatha Christie characters! Bet you know Sherlock Holmes! I'm also a big fan of the "world's best detective" (a.k.a Batman)! If you didn't read "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" from Agatha Christie, just DO IT! It's like, the best thing ever written. I have been slowly getting into the fantasy world, started with "Kings of the Wyld" from Nicholas Eames and is JUST my type of thing.</p>
    
    <p align="justify">I'm into sports too! Specially football! "É o <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eah4wXhlGME">Flamengo</a>, não tem jeito!" I also read a bunch of sports manga like Ao Ashi, Giant Killing, Eyeshield21, Hajime no Ippo, Slam Dunk...!
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Other than that, I'm often finding new things to learn. I've been learning to ~ gamedev ~ lately. And applying stuff that I have been studying to it.</p>

    <center> Nice to meet you!</center>
