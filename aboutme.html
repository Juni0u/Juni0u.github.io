    <center><h2>ABOUT ME...</h2></center>
    <div class="divider"></div>
    <p align="justify">Hi again!  My name is Felipe Nonato and I'm from Brazil! Although I started studying Electrical Engineering focused on power plants
      and electrical power systems, I moved to Computer Science! I'm not going to say I hated what I did, but I can say that I'm studying what I always 
      wanted to study! 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I am as Master's student in the University of Tsukuba under the supervision of Professor 
      <a href="http://conclave.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/">Claus Aranha</a>. My research specifically is focused on telling the story of a completed A.I.Wolf game. 
      I have been using graph theory to build a small text with events that make sense using content from the game! 
    </p>
    <p align="justify">I like to play rpg games. Persona and Dragon Age are my favorite series! I have been interested in soulslike lately too. Loved (and hated) playing Sekiro! 
                       I also like to read books with investigation stories. Mainly Agatha Christie, but I also loved Sherlock Holmes'! I'm also a big fan of the "world's best detective" (a.k.a Batman)!
                       I'm into sports too! Specially football! "É o <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eah4wXhlGME">Flamengo</a>, não tem jeito!"
    </p>
    <p align="justify">Other than that, I'm often finding new things to learn. I've been playing a bit with pico8 lately, applying evolutionary algorithms to a personal project...ah...I think I'll read on drawing techniques next...!
                       Oh! Don't mind me. Nice to meet you!
    </p>
