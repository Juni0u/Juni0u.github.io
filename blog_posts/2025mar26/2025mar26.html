        <p>This is pretty cool. Every little square that forms that square is moving on its own. Right now, they are moving randomly and I did put them in that starting position. I wanted to see what I&#39;m looking for, or at least one of the things that I&#39;m looking for. </p>
        <p>It is pretty cool! The whole idea of putting an energy source that has collision and can be moved around was to see if this sort of organization can be built. It&#39;s not really the same thing, but it reminds me of the mitochondrion and how it sources the organism with energy (sorry, not a biologist I&#39;m probably simplifying things a ton). Not only that, but how one of the theories of their origin is that mito-san (English is difficult, and I&#39;m being respectful!) was a single cell organism that developed a endosymbiotic relationship with another cell. Mito-san produces something good for the big one, and they live happily ever after.</p>
        <p>So there&#39;s a stretch. Mito-san in the video is a floppy disk that gathers energy and gives it to the squares that enter in its area. I didn&#39;t have plants for evolving Mito-san, but who knows? I have to finish things with square-guys first.</p>
        <p>Also, if you read the last blog post you may have noticed that food aren&#39;t particles anymore. I did this way because I was a bit afraid of dealing with a lot of collisions. But it&#39;s something that I may come back later.</p>
        <p>Right now, I want to make the squares share their energy when they are attached: Everybody dies if energy is down! Then, implement self-replication. Then build a simple probability table that will determine to which direction they move. I&#39;m heavily tending to implement a delay that will make them keep a chosen direction for some steps, but not sure yet. Still thinking about the last post too.</p>
        <p>Not related, but I also have being thinking on making a troll-game in pico8 just like the troll levels I often see in MarioMaker2... I know, random right? I&#39;d let you know my progress. Until next time!</p>
