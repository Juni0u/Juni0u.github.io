<p>Hello! I'm interested in Evolutionary Robotics, Artificial Life and Game Development! I like to experiment with genetic algorithms, open-ended systems, and physics-based simulations to explore emergent behaviors. I especially like the uncommon solutions evolution gives us! Currently, I'm researching modular robotic systems, focusing on how self-replicating structures and adaptive control mechanisms can lead to novel forms of movement and interaction. My goal is to bridge the gap between simulated evolution and real-world robotics, developing systems that can self-organize, adapt, and collaborate in unpredictable environments.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>EvoExperiment (2024)</strong><br>
Done with python, using pygame for visualization. I wanted to integrate markov chains to a GA. Plants in this environment can stay idle, eat or reproduce. Transition matrix determine how the state transition happens. These matrixes may mutate by changing the transition probabilities. Different levels of energy were considered to different state levels. Looking forward to add more interaction between plants.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>EvoPlants - PROCJAM2024 (2024)</strong><br>
-- <a href="https://djuniou.itch.io/rgplants">You can play here</a><br>
Done with python and pygame for visualization. Entry to procjam 2024. Each pixel may be occupied by a plant that has and RGB code as a gene. The color of each pixel is an average of the gene of its neighbors. Plants may either die, mutate or multiply themselves to its neighbors, each action determinated by chance. Changing mutation rates or included crossover between genes creates different color patterns in the screen. I intent to add more possible combinations. The web version needs to be updated.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Bloop!Jump - LOWRESJAM2023 (2023)</strong><br>
-- <a href="https://djuniou.itch.io/bloop-jump">You can play here</a><br>
Done with pico8. Entry to lowresjam 2023. A (difficult) platformer where a blob&#39;s goal is to get to the top of the stage. The blob can move left and right, its jump can be charged and if it hits a wall mid-jump, its trajectory can&#39;t be changed.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Rhymming and Saying (2023)</strong><br>
Done with Python. A formal grammar that uses wordnet to look for words that rhyme with selected sayings. Words of specifics classes (adjective, adverbs, etc) have their last phoneme compared to the last phoneme of the saying to ensure they rhyme. Sometimes we get funny outputs. </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>RPG NPC file creator (2023)</strong><br>
Done with Python. Used genetic algorithm to create characters files for a TTRPG that I played with friends. A file was received as an input together with the desired % of wins. A population of files is generated and then go thought evaluation, recombination, mutation and selection until a certain threshold. It was a cool way to get enemies balanced with the DungeonMaster&#39;s intention. (Or a way for me to test my character files) </p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Arduino Robot (2017)</strong><br>
Built with classmates during undergraduation. A wheeled robot that used ARDUINO-UNO to proccess signals from ultra-sound, clapper, magnetomer sensors and an app that could control the robot. The first three were used when the robot was on autonomous mode, and the last and an user was controlling it. </p>
</li>
